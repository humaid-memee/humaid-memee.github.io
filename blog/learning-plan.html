    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>At the moment, my future career goals haven't become more clear, but I have started to learn more about what I enjoy, I've really enjoyed the Javascript challenges, and definitely see myself enjoying working in a place where I get to work with Javascript.</p>
    <p>My idea of my limitations from Sprint 2 hasn't changed much, but I have learned about new limitations I would like to work on, most importantly, my communication skills. I think this will be really important when working with others during bootcamp, and could hinder me if I don't make improvements.</p>
    <p>I think my greatest non technical challenge at bootcamp will be staying on task and on track, I've noticed that I really struggled with this during foundations, but I will be sure to use the strategies I've developed during foundations to work on this.</p>
    <p>I would really like to improve on my communication skills during bootcamp, also, I want to improve on my reflective skills, I've found I can struggle with self reflection.</p>
    <p>My expecations from the bootcamp team are guidance around the tech and core skills, as well as support in general.</p>
    <p>I think when it comes to seeking help, I will first ask my peers, then facilitators. As to managing workload, I think continuing my daily goal setting around what needs to be accomplished that day will continue to be helpful. I think it is also important for me to look after my own well being, so I can be at my best. Finally, I'll do my best to be open and respectful when working with others.</p>

    <h1 class="page-top">My Learning Plan (Foundations)</h1> 
    <p>My long term career goal is to find work in the tech industry, ideally, I want to to work a job where I am constantly learning, being challenged as well as being supported. At the moment, I don't feel I know enough about the field to have a concrete idea of what type of job will allow me to do this, and I hope to learn more about the field as I continue studying at DevAcademy. On top of this, I want to figure out what I enjoy doing when it comes to web development, so I can find the right career for myself.</p>

    <p>When it comes to learning my main strengths are the fact that I am quick to pick up new concepts, I always think of how I can apply my new knowledge and when it comes to something I find interesting, I can really zone in. This last point can also become a limitation for me, as when it comes to something I don't find interesting I often become distracted and demotivated, this is something I want to improve in. Another limitation of mine is definitely staying on task and on track.</p>
    
    <p>There's a few skills I want to develop while at DevAcademy. One key skill is working in teams, while most of the time I work well in a team, I have found I struggle to keep the team workload balanced when under pressure. More often than not, I'll pick up extra work, bogging myself down under the assumption I'm actually helping the team, often at the expense of my actual tasks. Another skill I want to develop is communication, I find that I often 'over-explain', trying to answer questions before they are asked, while this initially seems helpful, it actually leads to an information overload, which leads to the core message being lost. Another skill I want to develop is giving effective feedback, I often struggle with how and when I should give feedback.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to managing workload, I noticed I did great in Sprint 1, but Sprint 2 has been a whole different story. I started off the week being unwell, and it really derailed my structure and schedule for the week. I think I need to commit more concretely to the hours I have planned on working in as well as holding myself accountable to the daily work goals I set for myself. Writing down my expectations and goals for the day has been really helpful, and I'll continue with this. 
      When things are building up and starting to get to me, I'll continue as I have, with reaching out to friends and family for support.</p>
    
    <p>When I need help, I'll look to our discord, I've become a lot more familiar with the discord and understand I can ask initially in the help channels, as well as reach out directly to a facilitator if necessary.</p>
    
    <p>From the Facilitation Team, I would love as much feedback as possible, as well pointing out the strengths and limitations I might not notice myself. Overall, I think I exepct guidance around the course and career development.</p>
    <p>My only other commitment is on Friday from 12.30pm to 1.45pm. This is when we have our weekly Friday prayers.</p>
