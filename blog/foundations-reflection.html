    <h1 class="page-top">Foundations Reflections</h1> 
    <p>Thanks to core learning, I've learnt three main things. First, I've learned that I need to work on my communication skills, specifically, making sure I don't over explain things, and give the other person time to listen and digest what I'm communicating. Another thing I have learned is that my ego sometimes gets in the way when I'm coding, particularly when it comes to seeking an alternative solution. I have noticed that I can get too entrenched in a particular way of solving something, so I hold back from trying other possibilities. Finally, I have learned about the growth mindset, and how it can appear differently in different aspects in our life, this has encouraged me to try and develop a growth mindset in more areas of my life.</p>
    <p>Values, empathy and self-awareness. I think values play a big role in our learning, as our values determine how we interact with the world, as such, a differetn set of values would result in a different learning experience, we might me more or less receptive to certain ideas due to our values. Empathy plays a role also, not so much when it comes to solo learning or porgramming, but when we learn our work with others, our understanding of other people determines our interactions with them. Finally, self awareness plays a big part in both learning and programming, if we're self aware, we can be concious of our biases nad habits, and lessen the impact they have on our learning or programming.</p>
    <p>The thing that suprised me most abbout the core learninig was the listening and looping exercise, I was surprised by how different the looping section could be based on what I intended to communicate. It was really valuable for me to understand that I need to work on my communication skills.</p>
    <p>I think the reason we focus so much on core learning is that it helps us to understand ourselves, how we learn, where our strengths and weaknesses lie, and where we can improve.</p>
    <p>Initially I was quite apprehnsive of core learning, as I didn't think it would be that beneficial. But I quickly realised it isn't at all a waste of time. It really helped me to change how I interacted with the content we're learning and become more self aware of my learning habits.</p>
