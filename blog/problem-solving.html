    <h4>Joining an array of strings</h4>
    <p>While working through the 'concatMyArray' kata, I initally thought it would be a very simple solution, as javascript has the join() built in method that allows you to join all the elements (each value of the array) in an array (a set of values grouped together) together and returning them. However, my code was failing the tests, even though I was certain it was right. I looked at the error message that the test had returned and saw that instead of getting something back from the code the test was getting an 'undefined' value. I googled this and realized I had forgotten to 'return' (this is statement which lets the function know what value to return) the value. It was quite a simple mistake and I felt it served as a reminder not to forget the very basics when working though code. It can be easy to get caught up in all the different complexities of writing code that we forget the basics. I've made similar mistakes before, like forgeting to declare a variable I'm using or missing a bracket or comma.</p>
    <h4>Adding a property to an object</h4>
    <p>During the gradebook kata, there was one question which asked us to add a property to an object (a set of values like an array, identifed with 'keys' (unique identifiers)). We were asked to add a object for each student in the gradebook. Initially I did this manually, typing out each line one by one. However, midway through I realized I could use a loop to do this, as it was a repetitive task. Before this I had never used a for of loop (a loop that loops through values in an array), I reqalized I could loop through the students array and add each student like this. I felt quite proud of myself as I hadn't used this type of solution before, and it made the fact I was progressing a bit more real for me. TNot only on this question, but throughout this exercise, I gained a better understanding of when to use loops and which loops were approriate where. </p>
    <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
    <p>Pseudocode: I've gotten more confident with using pseudocode, trying to use it as much as possible during the kata exercices. One drawback I have noticed is that sometimes I might be too specific in my pseudocode, which ends up leading me in the wrong direction. For example, in one exercise I had intially assumed I would need to create an empty array, which actually led to my code not working.</p>
    <p>Trying something: This is a method I am well familiar with, as it was originally my go to, I have learned that it isn't that useful, especially when it comes to more complex problems, it might pay off once in a while, when the first attempt is correct, but more often than not I would end up trying so many different things that it would have been more efficient to sit down and plan out in advance.</p>
    <p>Rubber ducky method: I have only used this once so far so I can't say for sure how confident I am with this, and I noticed that taking the time to try and explain what I'm doing actually allows me to notice when I'm working in the wrong direction. I think I've bcome less confident with this method.</p>
    <p>Reading error mesages: As I mentioned above, reading error messages has become increasingly useful for me, it is much more effective to try and figure out what an error message means rather than trying to spot an unknown problem in your code. However, I am still not fully confident with this, as some error messages are far too complicated.</p>
    <p>Console.logging: I'm getting more and more confident with console.logging, it seems to a really good method for checking in on code before you've reached youre 'final' solution.</p>
    <p>Googling: I am fairly confident with googling, recently I've started to realize what sources are more or less reliable.</p>
    <p>Asking peers for help: I recently asked for help, and my peers were really helpful, thanks to this I would say I've become more confident in asking my peers for help.</p>
    <p>Asking coaches for help: I am quite confident with this, I haven't asked for help from coaches often, but when I have there explanations have been great and have really clarified things for me.</p>
    <p>Improving my prorcess with reflection: I'm not too conifdent with this as I haven't really tried this before, but I'll be sure to give it a go.</p>
    <h4>Asking for help</h4>
    <p>While working on one of the katas I was completely stumped, I was certain the code I had written was correct, but it wasn't workkig at all. I was releucatnt to askl for help in this situation as I felt like I was just a little bit away from figuring out the problem, and so I decideed to continue working on things without asking for help. However, I eventually realised I couldn't figure out what was wrong and so reached out to the discord. Soon enough, someone reached out with what was wrong with my code. I think next time, I'll try and be a little mroe realistic in how far I am from a 'solution' </p>
