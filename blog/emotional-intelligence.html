    <h1 class="page-top">Emotional Intelligence</h1> 
      <p>Emotional Intelligence is being able to identify and manage one's own emotions as well as understanding the emotions of those around us. 
        There are five key aspects to emotional intelligence:

      <h4>What about IQ and EQ?</h4>
      <p>IQ is primarily focuses on our ability to solve problems, understand concepts, our ability with language and planning. EQ is focused more on emotions, empathy and self regulation.</p>
      <p>EQ is important is it relates directly to how we behave, for examply, if we're unable to identify the emotions we're feeling, then we may not even realize why we're feeling or acting a certain way. Beyond this, we might not behave properly in certain situations, or we may lack the ability to come to an understanding with others. All these different aspects will have an impact on our entire lives, whether that be our personal, social or work lives.</p>
