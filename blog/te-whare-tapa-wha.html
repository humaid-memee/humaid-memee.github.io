    <h4>My Wellbeing Plan</h4>
    <h4>Taha Tinana/Physical Wellbeing</h4>
    <p>For my physical well being, I will continue with my current exercise routine, going to the gym around 5 times a week. I think I would like to add some variety in the type of exercise I am doing, I'm considering going for runs outside to get some fresh air and really wake myself up in the mornings.</p>
    <h4>Taha Whanau/Family Wellbeing</h4>
    <p>I enjoy spending time and chatting with family and friends but it isn't something I strictly plan out weekly. I am cautious to set certain blocks of time to do this I feel like it runs the risk of becoming something I feel I 'have to' do rather than want to do.</p>
    <h4>Taha Hinengaro/Emotional and Mental Wellbeing</h4>
    <p>Exercise is something I've noticed is amazing for my emotional and mental wellbeing, so I'll definitely continue to do this often. I have also recently started writing a journal that I've found helpful. I'll continue building on these two habits.</p>
    <h4>Taha Wairua/Spiritual Wellbeing</h4>
    <p>Taking time during the day for mindfullness or appreciation has really helped, recently I've been trying to have at least 15 minutes spread throughout the day where I take a moment to pause and relax.</p>
    <h4>Whenua/Connections to the land</h4>
    <p>I think this is my weakest aspect at the moment, studying from home has meant I haven't been going out as much, on top of this, the recent weather has only compounded on this. Going on the runs I mentioned earlier would be helpful, especically if I run at the park or near the beach.</p>
