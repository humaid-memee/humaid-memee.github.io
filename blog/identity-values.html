    <h1 class="page-top">My Identity and Values</h1> 
      <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now:</h4>

      <p>At one of my wokrplaces we would deal with clients of different backgrounds, by chance, I was assigned to work on the file of a client who I knew personally. Here, I realised it could be an issue with the client's confidentiality. For me, honesty was the key value in this situation, I immediately raised the issue with my supervisor. My supervisor advise me that it would not be an issue from a legal or company policy standpoint, but I still asked for the file to assigned to someone else. I didn't want to learn information about someone, without their knowledge, even if it was okay from a professional standpoint. I am quite proud of the decision I made, as for me, it is important for my values to reflect in my professional behaviour.</p>
        
      <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity:</h4>
        
      <p>One of the key aspect of my values my cultural background has colored, would be my attitude towards elders and teachers. Personally, I afford an enromous amount of respect toward those older than me, and toward teachers. Beyond that, there is a clear responsibility I feel towards elders. In my personal and professional experiences, I think that it has helped me to build many great connections, and since respect often becomes a mutual bond, it has really helped to bond with people outside of my usual social sphere. But I do think I need to keep in mind any kind of bias this might create, as it is important to listen equally to everyone sitting at the table.</p>
        
      <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey:</h4>
        
      <p>My main strengths are open-mindedness, practicality and honesty. My open-mindedness serves me well when coming across new ideas and perspectives. I truly enjoy this part of learning, it really helps me stay enagaged with what I'm learning about. Practiciality helps in that whenever I learn something new, I immediately try to imagine situations and problems I could apply it to; this really helps in retaining new knowledge. Honesty is helpful in a personal sense, being honest with myself helps to accept when I don't know something, and seeking guidance to better learn.</p>
        
      <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey:</h4>
        
      <p>I think my greatest limitation at the moment is time management, I'm still adjusting to having a purely self directed schedule, and it is difficult to know how much and often I should be studying. I think I need to strike the right balance, as I can see myself becoming either burnt out our falling behind. I think the key here would be to work every day consistently.</p>
        
      <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why:</h4>
        
      <p>At one of my workplaces, I was hired to cope with a sudden influx of new work. This landed me in the middle of a stressful time from the organization and beyond that, an individually stressful time for many of my colleagues. I felt that some of my colleagues had become very personally frustrated at me, even though I was also doing my best with the limited knowledge that I had.
        My first instinct was to respond in kind, 'fighting fire with fire' in a sense. 
        What really helped in that situation was stepping back, and looking at the situation as a whole.
        It helped me to realise that my colleague was stressed, and seeing their circumstances, rather than escalating the situation, I made an effort to communicate with them, asking them how their ideal of the workflow between us would look. It resulted in us working a lot better together, with no conflict, and working so much more efficiently and effectively.</p>
        
     <p>Looking back, I think I would have tried to make more of an effort to understand my colleagues to begin with, this was dififcult, as our organization's structure and location made this difficult. I used to always brush off the idea of self introductions and meetings, but I think if we had the chance for something similar, and got a sense of each other's idenities and qualities, it woudl have avoided many issues.
