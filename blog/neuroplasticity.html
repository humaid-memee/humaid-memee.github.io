    <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is the capability of our brain to 'rewire' itself, forming new connections between neurons and pruning unecessary ones. Recognising the principles of neuroplasticity allows us to realise that we are all capable of creating changes in our brains. Realising that out capacity to learn and understand is not fixed, but malleable, can help motivate us when it comes to learning challenging and difficult concepts. Personally, I think I will keep in mind the principles of neuroplasiticty when playing chess, it's something new I've picked up, but can get extremely frustrating at times, I think keeping neuroplasiticy in mind will be beneficial in my journey. Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity are by learning a new, challenging skill, like a language or musical instrument. Another way to increase neuroplasticity is through visiting new places, or by having new experiences. Personally, I found this <a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being" target="_blank">page</a> from the University of Utah very informative. It goes into depth on how exactly to engage with a new skill to beenfit neuroplasiticty.</p>
    <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
    <p>Growth mindset is the mentality that our intelligence and capabilities are not fixed. A fixed mindset is just the opposite, beleieved our intelligence is fixed. It is important to keep in mind that we don't adhere to only one of these mindset, rather, we can apply parts of these, or one mindset entirely to different parts of our lives. Understanding this fact was key for me, as I might have put myself in one box or another, but now I can really invesitigate how I approach different activities and skills, and try and navigate myself to have a growth mindset in all aspects of my life. When it comes to my learning journey, I always assumed that I wasn't the type of person who was good at creating a structured study plan for myself and adhering to it. But now that I'm aware of this idea, I've realised that it is possible for me to start to integrate and improve on this into my overall learning. I found this <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means" target="_blank">article</a> by Carol Dweck really interesting, where she talks about what a growth mindset for organisations and companies.</p>
    <h4>Thoughts...</h4>
    <p>Learning about the growth mindset and neuroplasticity will definitely change how I approach my learning plan and strategy. Previously, I had only thought about methods I had tried before and had worked well for me, avoiding new strategies and methods. But I think I'll now be more willing to try new strategies. Like I mentioned above, I'll start incorportating a much more structured approach to my planning and learning. I look forward to how things might change.</p>
